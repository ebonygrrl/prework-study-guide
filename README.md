# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

My motivation behind this project was to get used to using Git and GitHub. I have had very little interaction with version control and something as simple as a web guide made for good practice. 

The problem this project solves eliminating the need for physical notes. I have learned and feel more comfortable with Git Bash, Visual Studio Code and understanding how these interfaces work together.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
